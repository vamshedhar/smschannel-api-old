sms-channel-api
==============================

API of sms portal of IIT Roorkee Saharanpur Campus. Developed by IMG, IIT Roorkee-Saharanpur Campus

Getting up and running
----------------------

The steps below will get you up and running with a local development environment. We assume you have the following installed:

* pip
* virtualenv
* PostgreSQL

First make sure to create and activate a virtualenv_, then open a terminal at the project root and install the requirements for local development::

    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt

.. _virtualenv: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

You can now run the ``runserver_plus`` command::

    $ python sms-channel-api/manage.py runserver_plus

The base app will run but you'll need to carry out a few steps to make the sign-up and login forms work. These are currently detailed in `issue #39`_.
